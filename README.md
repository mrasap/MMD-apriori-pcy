## Mining massive datasets algorithm implementations

Based on the algorithm described in "Mining of Massive Datasets" by Leskovec, Rajaman and Ullman.

This is my effort to implement the algorithms in python.   
I utilize numpy for the linear algebra parts, as well as pytest to verify some system tests.

Note, the youtube links refer to the most relevant parts of the lectures on the subject.
